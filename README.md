# üöë Heuristics and Optimization: Ambulance Allocation and Patient Transfer

This project focuses on solving two distinct problems: allocating ambulances in a parking lot under various constraints and optimizing the transfer of patients using heuristic search algorithms.

## üìù Problem Overview

### Part 1: **Ambulance Allocation**
- **Goal**: Allocate ambulances to parking spaces while respecting constraints like:
  - Electric connections required for specific ambulances.
  - No ambulance blocking emergency vehicles.
  - Adjacency and space restrictions.
- **Approach**: Modeled as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** using the Python `constraint` library.

### Part 2: **Patient Transfer Optimization**
- **Goal**: Minimize the time and energy required to transport patients between homes, care centers, and parking lots.
- **Approach**: Implemented with heuristic search algorithms, specifically **A\***, utilizing multiple heuristic functions to evaluate performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Ambulance Allocation (Part 1)**:
  - Define constraints and allocate parking spaces.
  - Validate scenarios with Python `constraint`.
  - Includes test cases for extreme and edge scenarios.

- **Patient Transfer Optimization (Part 2)**:
  - Implemented the **A\*** algorithm.
  - Designed and analyzed four different heuristic models:
    1. Basic relaxed constraints.
    2. Fully informed heuristics.
    3. Priority-based heuristics.
    4. Relaxed capacity constraints.
